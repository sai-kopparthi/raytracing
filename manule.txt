hi!
Thus project you basically you implement a raytracing on the sphere
Instructions
1>to run the code enter "make" where you complile all the class files available by creating their correspoing object files.
2>and the enter the recursion index to how extent you want to implement ray splitings and this is done by recursive funcion call defined in tracer.cc file
3>then enter "./raytracing"
you get the output of there sphere with their reflections on the other sphere.
and moreover I implemented this one to display it in ".ppm" file rather than glut display window which is very quite intresting.
